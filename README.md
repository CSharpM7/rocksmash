# Rock Smash

Gives Zard his old Rock Smash move on Neutral Special. Not for redistribution as is, but you may ask permission to put it in a part of your moveset modpack. Only works on c00, so you'll need to copy the relevant files across c01-c07. If you single slot this like a jim, I'll cut your toenails in an uneven fashion.
